            <p class="text3">Vancouver Island is simply paradise, an adventure-packed destination full of 
                amazing seaside views as well as a haven for wildlife. While it is often overlooked and takes 
                a 2hr ferry ride from Vancouver city to get there, visiting here is certainly worth it especially for anyone 
                who likes nature and exploration.

            <p class="text3">Vancouver Island's coastal scenery (top) is breathtaking, with both the western part of the island
                near Tofino and Eastern part near the fjord of Knight Inlet being incredibly scenic, highlighted by the mountains of the nearby islands
                rising above the water. My favorite hike on the island was the Wild Pacific Trail in Ucluelet (bottom left, bottom center), a perfect and relaxing walk 
                past the island's rocky shoreline. The beaches (bottom right) of Tofino are also a great place to relax and 
                enjoy the surrounding island scenery.

            <p class="text3">The wildlife viewing opportunities of the island are top-notch, with Bears being 
                my favorite. In Tofino, bears can be viewed from a scenic boat tour taking you across the stunning islands,
                with my best bear sighting by far was that of a mother black bear and her 2 cubs (Top row, first 3) hanging 
                out on the rocky beaches. The trio was just so cute and adorable to watch flipping rocks on the beach 
                in search for food. Just as cool though were the other single black bears I got to see on the 
                shores of Tofino, truly beautiful and a surreal experience to view up close.

            <p class="text3">I also got to see plenty of bears in the islands and shores around Knight Inlet off the coast of 
                northeastern Vancouver Island. On the boat tour here, I first got to briefly see a Grizzly Bear in the distance (top left)
                before witnessing several beautiful black bears in separate spots hanging out on the rocky coastline. These sightings, along with 
                the bears in the surroundings of Tofino, were some of my most memorable experiences viewing any wild animals, making Vancouver Island in general 
                one of the best places in the world for Bear viewing in the wild.

            <p class="text3">While bears were the highlight, Vancouver Island is also home to tons of other 
                amazing creatures. In Tofino, I got to see this large colony of Harbour Seals on a small island (top left, top center)
                as well as an adorable Sea otter just (bottom left, bottom center) outside Tofino's marina. Along with bears, I also got to 
                watch a mother deer and her two fawns (right column) hang out in the wetland grasses of Knight Inlet's shores 
                as well as tons of birds in the vicinity.

            <p class="text3">Besides the bears, what made Vancouver Island so cool for me was whale watching. 
                Besides getting to see a Humpback whale on the ferry to the island, I got to witness a huge 
                pod of Orcas in the inlets of Tofino, hunting the seals mentioned above. It was like a 
                National Geographic scene to me, watching the Orcas close in on the seals and the seals rushing 
                off the small island for survival. Ultimately, the classic coastal scenery as well as the many unique wildlife sightings I had here
                make Vancouver Island one of my favorite places I've ever visited and one of the most underrated 
                natural wonders in all of Canada.
