            <p class="text3">Located near Jiuzhaigou in Northern Sichuan, the Huanglong Scenic Area is just as 
                beautiful as Jiuzhaigou and perhaps even more otherworldly. Huanglong is often paired with a visit to Jiuzhaigou, and 
                the landform is formed by calcite deposits, creating these crystal clear turquoise pools on top of 
                the golden landscape, which is just awesome to see up close.

            <p class="text3">The hiking around the gorgeous pools of Huanglong is simply awesome. There are so 
                many crazy views of the golden landform and the small turquoise lakes, from giant cluster of 
                lakes at the start to the glorious waterfalls at the end. Combined 
                with the mountains in the backdrop, it just makes for the ultimate out-of-this-world experience in 
                perhaps China's most underrated natural spot.
